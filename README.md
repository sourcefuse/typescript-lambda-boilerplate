## Quality Control  
This repo leverages Pre-Commit to ensure code quality and standardization.  

To get started, install pre-commit:  
```shell
pip install pre-commit
``` 

Once pre-commit is installed, run `pre-commit install` from the root of this repo. This executes 
prior to commits to the repo.
